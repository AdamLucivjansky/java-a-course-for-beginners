## Best Use of Course Guide
In this video, we would help you understand how to make the best use of the Course Guide.
The course guide contains:
Details of all the course sections
What exactly do we do in that section?
Step by step details for each section?
Description of exercises for each section
Code snippets and the programs

If you face any errors, you can use the guide to compare and find the problem.

You can also use the course guide when you'd want to revise the concepts. So, you can go into the collections,look at all the things that we have learned, all the code that we have executed, and try to recollect all the things that we have done around it.

I hope you are having a lot of fun and I'll see you in the next step.



##  JShell



Do you know what all great programmers do when they would want to quickly try something? They use JShell.
That's why we use JShell to start learning Java in this course. In the first few sections of the course,
we use JShell to help you get familiar with Java syntax.  With JShell, you make a mistake and JShell immediately tells you what is wrong. Once you are familiar with the basic Java syntax, we'll use the IDE Eclipse. Learning to use JShell is an essential part of learning Java and the great thing about JShell is that you can use JShell available online.

If you have any trouble installing Java on your local machine, you can use JShell from tryjshell.org

Once you get through the formalities of getting started with the course, we will help you to install Java in Section 2. Section 3 and section 4 use JShell. This helps you to get quickly started with Java syntax and solve any common mistakes that Java beginners tend to make.

And after that, we would use an amazing IDE called Eclipse. All the sections starting from Section 5 use Eclipse as the IDE.

A quick tip before you go further with the course. 
Some beginners can face a little bit of trouble installing Java.

One of the important things that you need to remember is to make sure to set something called a Path variable. Step 4 in Section 2 would help you to do that.

If you have any problems installing Java following the instructions in the next section, then don't hesitate to post it in the Q&A. If you're able to install Java successfully on your local machine following the instructions in Section 2, then you can use JShell in your local machine or if you have any problems, what you can do is, while you figure out your problems with installing Java, you can use tryjshell to get started with the first few sections. Do you want to be a modern Java Developer?

Let's get started with learning Java using JShell.


## Install Java
Welcome to this guide where we would help you install Java and Eclipse.

This course is compatible with all latest versions of Java
We are installing JDK, the Java Development Kit

We would want to write programs, we would want to compile them,
we would want to run them and all this is made easy by the Java development kit. 

Go to Google and search for Java JDK download. 
Make a note of this particular folder. 

We'd check for two things: Java and JShell
java -version
jshell -version

jshell
6*8
/exit


## Troubleshooting

Uninstall any of the pre-existing Java installs.

Firewalls or anti-virus software.  Temporarily turn them off and install Java and see if it works out fine.

Corrupted Download - Download again

Java 9 only support a 64-bit Windows. It no longer supports 32-bit Windows. So, make sure that you are using a 64-bit Windows operating system.

The last thing you can check is the path variable. We will look at the path variable in the next video and how to set it for Windows.

How does the operating system know where jshell is present?

Goto C:\Program Files\Java on your local machine, you should see a number of folders like this. Try and locate the folder jdk-9 Don't worry about the minor versions C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4.
BIN path - C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4\bin.

Path is an environment variable.

- Ctrl + Esc and type in env. So, type in env => Edit the system environment variables
- Start, select Control Panel, then go to System, Advanced and then go to Environment Variables.
- back up of the content of your path. 

Restart command prompt
